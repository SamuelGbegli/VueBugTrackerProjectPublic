# VueBugTrackerProject

This is an ongoing project to create a web application where a user can record and keep track of bugs in projects they are developing. This was inspired by previous work I had done that was prompted by a video claiming this project would guarantee a software development job, and I also wanted to practice creating a client application with a JavaScript framework (i.e. Vue).

This is primairly meant for demonstration purposes, so I have no plans to deploy it and make it live.
