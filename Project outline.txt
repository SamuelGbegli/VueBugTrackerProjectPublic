As the main purpose of the app is to demonstrate me finding and fixing bugs throughout development,
I will focus on the minimum steps required to do this

Part 1

Enums

Frontend page template (navbar and credits footer) (in progress)

Noted glitches:
- If the user logs in, logs out and logs in again, the sidebar remains open
- It is possible for someone to create an account with all white spaces (e.g., "    ")
- There is no "valid format" for a user name
- Form fields show error messages when user types in them for the first time
- User is logged out when moving to another page and the Backend is disabled
- Password reset error is briefly visible when valid ID and token is supplied
- Users are not redirected when logging in while on a page only non-logged in users are supposed to see
- Log in prompt is briefly visible when accessing a restricted page
- Page elements do not refresh when logging out
- No loading control in bug overview page
- when filter is reset in bug search page, the current filter values are gone
- user can view project settings page when not the owner
